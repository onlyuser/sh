About:
    sh is a collection of shell scripts used to maintain XLang.
    Currently, it includes the following:
        xgrep   -- a grep wrapper that screens filenames before grepping
        xrefact -- a script for refactoring code
        xform   -- a script for applying my coding conventions
        diff.py -- a meld wrapper for better git diff experience

xgrep:
    Synopsis:
        xgrep <FILENAME> [SEARCH_STR]

    Description:
        Searches for SEARCH_STR in files matched by FILENAME.
        If SEARCH_STR not given, simply lists files matched by FILENAME.

        FILENAME   -- regex describing which files to apply action
        SEARCH_STR -- grepped regex to apply to files matched

xrefact:
    Synopsis:
        xrefact <FILENAME> <SEARCH_STR> <REPLACE_STR> [IGNORE_COLLISION={1/0}]

    Description:
        Replaces SEARCH_STR with REPLACE_STR for files matched by FILENAME.
        If IGNORE_COLLISION is 0, skips replaces that produce new occurrences of SEARCH_STR.
        Replaces files named SEARCH_STR to REPLACE_STR as well.
        IGNORE_COLLISION also applies to file renaming, with analogous functionality.

        FILENAME         -- regex describing which files to apply action
        SEARCH_STR       -- grepped regex to apply to files matched
        REPLACE_STR      -- string to replace SEARCH_STR
        IGNORE_COLLISION -- 1 for force replace, 0 for skipping collision case

xform:
    Synopsis:
        xform <FILENAME>

    Description:
        Applies formatting rules to files matched by FILENAME.

        FILENAME -- regex describing which files to apply action

        Format rules:
            unify indent
            trim trailing space
            unify empty brace spacing
            unify control-statement spacing
            unify postfix spacing *
            STL headers (remove file extension + replace quotes with angle braces)
            C++ headers (remove file extension + replace quotes with angle braces)
            C headers (replace quotes with angle braces)

            * unify spacing after "#include" and "namespace"

Requirements:
    Add these lines to your .bashrc to gain PATH access (to my scripts):
        export PATH=sh:$PATH
        export PATH=sh/xargs:$PATH

    Add these lines to your .bashrc to use diff.py:
        #git config --global diff.external meld
        git config --global diff.external sh/diff.py

Keywords:
    shell scripting, bash, git, meld
