About:

    sh is a collection of shell scripts used to maintain XLang.
    Currently, it includes the following:

        xgrep   -- a grep wrapper that screens filenames before grepping
        xrefact -- a script for refactoring code
        xform   -- a script for applying my coding conventions
        diff.py -- a meld wrapper for better git diff experience

Requirements:

    Add these lines to your .bashrc to gain PATH access (to my scripts):

        export PATH=sh:$PATH
        export PATH=sh/xargs:$PATH

    Add these lines to your .bashrc to use diff.py:

        #git config --global diff.external meld
        git config --global diff.external sh/diff.py

Keywords:

    shell scripting, bash, git, meld
